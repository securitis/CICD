# The HCL AppScan CodeSweep for GitHub extension enables you to check your code on 
# every pull request. Run as a GitHub action, the extension identifies vulnerabilities 
# in changed code with every update. But more than just identifying issues, the HCL 
# AppScan CodeSweep for GitHub extension tells you what you need to know to mitigate 
# issues — before they make it to the main branch.
